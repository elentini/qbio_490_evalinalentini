Each person must individually push their code to Github. *At the top of your R Notebook, write the name of you and your partner(s) as a comment.*

***Complete the following coding activity and answer any following questions as comments in your R Notebook***

In this assignment, you will need to use your skills learned in class to demonstrate your understanding of categorical variables and R data structures.

*Pre-Assignment*
Load all necessary packages, read in the clinical data.csv file you have in your analysis_data folder, and instantiate the MAF_object.

```{r}

if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("TCGAbiolinks", ask = FALSE, update = TRUE, force = TRUE)
BiocManager::install(c("maftools", "SummarizedExperiment", "GenomicDataCommons", "dplyr"),
                     ask = FALSE, force = TRUE)

library(TCGAbiolinks)
library(maftools)
library(dplyr)

clin_query <- GDCquery(project = "TCGA-BRCA",
data.category = "Clinical",
data.type = "Clinical Supplement",
data.format = 'BCR Biotab')
GDCdownload(clin_query)
clinical.BCRtab.all <- GDCprepare(clin_query)
clinic <- clinical.BCRtab.all$clinical_patient_brca[-c(1,2),]

colnames(clinic)[ colnames(clinic) == "bcr_patient_barcode" ] <-
"Tumor_Sample_Barcode"
maf_query <- GDCquery(
project = "TCGA-BRCA",
data.category = "Simple Nucleotide Variation",
access = "open",
data.type = "Masked Somatic Mutation",
workflow.type = "Aliquot Ensemble Somatic Variant Merging and Masking"
)
```
```{r}
GDCdownload(maf_query, method = "api", files.per.chunk = 100)
maf <- GDCprepare(maf_query)
maf_object <- read.maf(maf = maf,
clinicalData = clinic,
isTCGA = TRUE)
```



It's useful to save your MAF_object, so that you don't have to go through the trouble of querying and preparing it everytime. The saveRDS function allows us to save an R object, allowing us to access it directly from our files. 
```{r}
 saveRDS(maf_object, file = "/home1/elentini/490_cluster/analysis_data/maf_object.rds")
```

When you reopen a new R session and want to access your MAF_object, you can use the readRDS function to load the object back into a new variable.
```{r}
MAF_object <- readRDS(file = "/home1/elentini/490_cluster/analysis_data/maf_object.rds")
```

*1*
Choose a clinical variable (or any variable from clin_rad or clin_drug) to separate your populations into two different groups and rewrite the column or create a new column with that variable as a factor. ***Do not use age or vital_status as your clinical variable.*** Hint: if your variable is continuous, you will need to determine your own cutoffs for the different levels of the factor. If your variable is categorical and has more than two possible values, choose the two that are the most common.
```{r}
table(clinic$tumor_status)
table(clinic$gender)

clinic_filtered <- clinic %>%
  filter(!is.na(tumor_status),
         tumor_status %in% c("WITH TUMOR", "TUMOR FREE"),
         gender %in% c("FEMALE", "MALE")) %>%
  mutate(tumor_group = factor(tumor_status, levels = c("WITH TUMOR", "TUMOR FREE")),
         gender_group = factor(gender, levels = c("FEMALE", "MALE")))

table(clinic_filtered$tumor_group)
summary(clinic_filtered$tumor_group)

table(clinic_filtered$gender_group)
summary(clinic_filtered$gender_group)
```


*2*
Create a co-oncoplot with the top 10-20 (you choose) most mutated genes for the two groups. Pick one that has a large discrepancy in % mutated or type of mutations between the groups and research it. 
Research it. What is the gene used for? Can you think of any reason for the discrepancy?
```{r}
female_barcodes <- clinic_filtered %>%
  filter(gender_group == "FEMALE") %>%
  pull(Tumor_Sample_Barcode)

male_barcodes <- clinic_filtered %>%
  filter(gender_group == "MALE") %>%
  pull(Tumor_Sample_Barcode)

maf_female <- subsetMaf(maf = maf_object, tsb = female_barcodes)
maf_male <- subsetMaf(maf = maf_object, tsb = male_barcodes)

top_genes <- getGeneSummary(maf_object) %>%
  arrange(desc(AlteredSamples)) %>%
  head(15) %>%
  pull(Hugo_Symbol)

coOncoplot(
  m1 = maf_female,
  m2 = maf_male,
  genes = top_genes,
  m1Name = "Female",
  m2Name = "Male",
  removeNonMutated = TRUE
)
```
One of the biggest differences between the two groups was in MUC16. It codes for a surface protein (also known as CA-125) that’s super common in a lot of cancers and helps tumor cells hide from the immune system. The difference between males and females could be tied to hormone effects or just differences in tumor types, since MUC16 is more active in hormone-related tissues.


*3*
Create a contingency table with your variable and chosen gene. Run a Fisher’s Exact Test between presence of mutations for that gene and your clinical variable. Create and save a mosaic plot. 
Interpret the output of the Fisher’s Exact Test in terms of the odds ratio and p-value.
```{r}
library(maftools)
library(ggplot2)

muc16_status <- subsetMaf(maf = maf_object, genes = "MUC16", fields = "Tumor_Sample_Barcode")@data$Tumor_Sample_Barcode
clinic_filtered$MUC16_mut <- ifelse(clinic_filtered$Tumor_Sample_Barcode %in% muc16_status, "Mutated", "Not Mutated")

contingency <- table(clinic_filtered$MUC16_mut, clinic_filtered$gender_group)
contingency

fisher_result <- fisher.test(contingency)
fisher_result

png("muc16_gender_mosaic.png", width = 1200, height = 900)
mosaicplot(contingency,
           main = "MUC16 Mutation vs Gender",
           color = TRUE,
           xlab = "MUC16 Mutation Status",
           ylab = "Gender")
dev.off()
```
The Fisher’s Exact Test showed no significant association between MUC16 mutations and gender. The p-value was 1, indicating that mutation frequency was almost identical between males and females. The odds ratio was close to 1, meaning there’s no real difference in likelihood of mutation between groups. This suggests that, in this dataset, MUC16 mutations occur independently of gender and are likely driven by overall tumor mutation burden rather than sex-specific factors.

*4*
Subset your maf_object based on your chosen clinical variable and create a co-lollipop plot of your chosen gene divided between the two different clinical variable possibilities. Include descriptive names on your plot.
Do you notice any difference in terms of mutations (e.g. sites, types, number) between the two populations?
```{r}
library(maftools)

maf_female <- subsetMaf(maf = maf_object, tsb = clinic_filtered$Tumor_Sample_Barcode[clinic_filtered$gender_group == "FEMALE"])
maf_male <- subsetMaf(maf = maf_object, tsb = clinic_filtered$Tumor_Sample_Barcode[clinic_filtered$gender_group == "MALE"])

lollipopPlot2(
  m1 = maf_female,
  m2 = maf_male,
  m1_name = "Female Patients",
  m2_name = "Male Patients",
  gene = "MUC16"
)

ggsave("MUC16_gender_coLollipop.png")
```
From the co-lollipop plot, there aren’t major differences between males and females in terms of MUC16 mutations. Both groups show mostly missense mutations (green dots) scattered across similar regions of the gene, with very few nonsense or frameshift mutations. The overall mutation frequency is almost the same—around 10% in both groups, and the distribution of mutation sites appears uniform. This supports the Fisher’s Exact Test result (p = 1), indicating no meaningful difference in mutation type, number, or position between male and female patients.

*5*
Create your Overall_Survival_Status column and create a mafSurvival KM plot based on mutations in your chosen gene.
Does there seem to be a difference? Hypothesize why or not based on the other analysis you did with the gene above.
```{r}
library(maftools)
library(dplyr)

clinic_filtered$survival_time <- ifelse(clinic_filtered$last_contact_days_to == "[Not Available]",
                                        clinic_filtered$death_days_to,
                                        clinic_filtered$last_contact_days_to)

clinic_filtered$survival_time <- as.numeric(clinic_filtered$survival_time)

clinic_filtered$death_event <- ifelse(clinic_filtered$vital_status == "Dead", TRUE, FALSE)

mafSurvival(
  maf = maf_object,
  clinicalData = clinic_filtered,
  time = "survival_time",
  Status = "death_event",
  gene = "MUC16"
)
```
When I created the KM plot for MUC16, there didn’t seem to be much difference in survival between patients with and without mutations. The p-value was around 0.82 and the hazard ratio was close to 1, meaning the two groups had almost identical outcomes. This makes sense based on my earlier results—MUC16 mutations were distributed similarly between males and females, and most were missense mutations scattered across the gene. Since MUC16 is such a large gene, many of these are probably passenger mutations that don’t really impact survival.
